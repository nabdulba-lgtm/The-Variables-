The Gradebook class serves as the core storage system for all grade records in the program. It maintains a list, where each element is a dictionary containing information such as student name, assignment type, score, lateness status, and week of completion. The purpose of this class is not to calculate averages or organize data by student; rather, its job is to store information consistently and to allow other classes or functions to access it. Internally, the Gradebook class uses two simple methods: add_record(record), which appends a new grade dictionary to the list, and get_all_records(), which retrieves the full list of stored grades.

In the example usage, a Gradebook object is created and then the add_record() method is called multiple times to add grade dictionaries into the shared gradebook. Each grade added includes detailed keys that make the record compatible with student objects and filtering functions across the system. The example demonstrates that there is no restriction on what type of grades are stored — quizzes, homework, exams, and projects can all coexist because the class simply preserves whatever data is inserted into it. This shows that the Gradebook behaves as a centralized database for the entire system.

When the example calls print(gradebook.get_all_records()), the expected output is a full list containing all of the grade records that were added. Each element of the list reflects exactly what was inserted with no modifications or processing done by the Gradebook class. The output demonstrates successful data storage and retrieval, confirming that other parts of the system — such as the Student class and filtering functions — will have accurate and complete access to all grade data.

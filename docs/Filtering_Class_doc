The filtering functions module provides several independent utilities that analyze grade data without modifying the Gradebook. Each function accepts a list of grade dictionaries and returns a new list with only records that satisfy a specific condition. For example, filter_by_assignment_type() returns only quizzes or only exams, filter_late_submissions() returns only the grades marked as late, and filter_by_score_range() selects records whose score falls within a specific numerical threshold. In addition, filter_by_student_name() matches a given student name regardless of capitalization, and filter_by_week() retrieves grades submitted during a particular week.

In the example, functions are applied to the same list of grade dictionaries with different filtering criteria. For instance, one call isolates only “quiz” assignments, while another extracts only the grades with scores between 85 and 100. None of these functions alter the original list — they create a separate copy of the data containing only the entries that match the requested conditions. This confirms that the filtering module behaves like a report-generating tool rather than a storage mechanism.

The output of each example consists of filtered lists printed to the console. For example, calling filter_late_submissions() on a list where only one assignment has "is_late": True will output a list containing only that entry. Likewise, calling filter_by_student_name(grades, "alex") will return all matching entries — even if the record contains "Alex", "alex", or "ALEX". These results prove that the filtering functions work correctly, enabling instructors or students to generate targeted academic reports such as score breakdowns, weekly summaries, missing assignments, and late-only submissions.

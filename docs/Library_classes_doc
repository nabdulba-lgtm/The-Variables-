#The LibraryItem class serves as the foundational architecture for the entire library system. It defines shared attributes and behaviors that all item types—such as books and DVDs—inherit. The class stores key data such as item_id, title, and copies, encapsulating the identifying information for any library object. It includes essential getter and setter methods, as well as a check_out() and check_in() method, which track how many copies of an item are available. Because this class is abstract in design, it sets the structural precedent for all derived items that extend its functionality.

Inside the code, the constructor (__init__) initializes the item’s core attributes, and each method affects the state of copies. check_out() decreases the copy count only if at least one copy exists, preventing negative inventory and ensuring data integrity. Conversely, check_in() increases the number of available copies. The class also includes a __str__() method to return formatted item information when printed. Because all child classes call super().__init__(), they inherit this structure and gain the standard inventory-management functionality without rewriting code.

In the example program, an object such as LibraryItem("B001", "The Odyssey", 3) is created and stored in the system. When printed, the output displays something like:
LibraryItem[ID: B001, Title: The Odyssey, Copies: 3].
If check_out() is called once, the output after printing the object again becomes Copies: 2. If check_out() is called too many times, the system prints a warning message instead of reducing the count below zero. This demonstrates validation and safe resource management.

The Student class represents an individual learner who is enrolled in a course and interacts with the shared Gradebook instance. Each Student object stores its own name and course while also holding a reference to the gradebook passed in during initialization. The Student class enforces ownership control by requiring that any grade added using add_grade(record) must list the student’s name correctly. If a grade record belongs to a different student, the method raises a ValueError. The class also provides get_grades() to retrieve only that student’s grades and get_average() to compute their mean score while returning 0.0 if no grades are present.

In the example usage, a Student object is created, and a grade record generated by an assignment is passed into the student’s add_grade() function. The validation step checks that the name field within the record matches the Student object’s name before storing it into the Gradebook. When get_grades() is called, the method iterates through the Gradebook’s stored records and returns a list containing only the entries where the name key matches the student. Later, when get_average() is executed, the Student class computes the arithmetic mean based on all of the stored percentages.

The expected output of running the student example includes a printed list of grade records belonging only to that student, followed by the calculated average score. For example, if the student has two scores—90% and 80%—the printed average would be 85.0. If a student attempts to add a grade record with a different student name inside the dictionary, the code would output an error message such as: “ValueError: Record does not belong to this student.” This confirms that the Student class protects gradebook integrity and ensures that students cannot alter one another’s academic history.

The Assignment class defines the properties and rules for creating structured assignment grade entries. Each assignment has a name, an assignment type (for example, homework, quiz, exam, or project), a maximum possible point value, and a designated week number. The class includes a method called calculate_percentage(points_earned) that converts raw points to a percentage score. It also provides create_grade_record(student_name, points_earned, is_late=False), which validates the score and constructs a dictionary containing all necessary information to be stored in the Gradebook.

In the example, an assignment such as “Homework 1” with a max score of 100 is created and then given to a student who earns a certain number of points. When the record is generated, the Assignment class checks that the earned points do not exceed the max or drop below zero. If the number is valid, a grade dictionary is produced, containing keys such as "name", "assignment_type", "score", "is_late", and "week". This dictionary is then ready to be passed into Student.add_grade() so that it can be stored into the Gradebook.

The output of the example should be a complete and standardized grade record, such as:
{'name': 'Alex', 'assignment_type': 'homework', 'score': 92.0, 'is_late': False, 'week': 2}.
If the student earns more than the maximum score or a negative score, the expected result changes — instead of a dictionary being created, the Assignment class raises a ValueError and stops execution. This proves that the Assignment class ensures data correctness before grade records are stored.
